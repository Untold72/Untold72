### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jens, I'm 26 years old. I am a Programmer in training at Arteveldehogeschool.
I like to make small games in my free time with Unity and C#. I also enjoy just playing some games with friends. 

i'm currently learning Javascript, html and css at the moment, but i would like to take a dive in laravel aswell.

I would love to make it as a programmer and do what i really like doing. I think its fun to see what you're creating on the spot!ðŸ˜ƒ
